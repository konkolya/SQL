--First, I was to find out what happened on 15/01/2018 in SQL City:

SELECT * FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE date LIKE 20180115 AND city="SQL City";

--Result: Murder. Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. 
--The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".

-- Next, I was looking for the first witness in the person table (looking for the house with the highest number in the street):

SELECT * 
FROM person
WHERE address_street_name LIKE "Northwe%"
ORDER BY address_number desc

--First witness is: Morty Schapiro (id:	14887,  4919 Northwestern Dr, license ID: 118009, SSN: 111564949)

--Let's look for the second witness: 

SELECT * 
FROM person
WHERE name LIKE "%Annab%" AND address_street_name LIKE "%Franklin%"

--Second witness is: Annabel Miller (id: 16371, 103 Franklin Ave, license ID: 490173, SSN: 318771143)

--Let's check their interview:

SELECT * 
FROM interview
WHERE person_id IN (14887, 16371);

--SCHAPIRO: "I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". 
--Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W"."
--MILLER: "I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th."

--Let's check gold members of the gym that have a membership number started with "48Z".

SELECT *
FROM get_fit_now_member
WHERE membership_status="gold"
AND id LIKE "%48Z%";

--Two possible persons:
--Joe GERMUSKA (id: 48Z7A, person id: 28819, membership start date: 20160305) OR
--Jeremy BOWERS (id: 48Z55, person id: 67318, membership start date: 20160101)

--Let's check who out of the two was there in the gym on 9 January:

SELECT * 
FROM get_fit_now_check_in WHERE membership_id in ("48Z7A", "48Z55")

--Apparently, both of them (GERMUSKA checked in at 16:00 and out at 17:30, BOWERS checked in at 15:30 and checked out at 17:00). 
--Let's find out then who owns a car with the given licence plate number:

SELECT person.name, drivers_license.* 
FROM drivers_license 
JOIN person ON drivers_license.id = person.license_id
WHERE plate_number LIKE "%H42W%"

--It's BOWERS (id: 423327, age: 30, height: 70, eye: brown, hair: brown, licence plate: 0H42W2, car: Chevrolet Spark LS)

INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Jeremy Bowers');
        
        SELECT value FROM solution;
        
--"Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... 
--If you think you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. 
--If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries. 
--Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer."


SELECT * FROM interview
WHERE person_id IN (67318)   


--I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). 
--She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. 
--I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.
