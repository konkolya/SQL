--First, I was to find out what happened on 15/01/2018 in SQL City:

SELECT * FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE date LIKE 20180115 AND city="SQL City";

--Result: Murder. Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. 
--The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".

-- Next, I was looking for the first witness in the person table (looking for the house with the highest number in the street):

SELECT * 
FROM person
WHERE address_street_name LIKE "Northwe%"
ORDER BY address_number desc

--First witness is: Morty Schapiro,	Northwestern Dr	4919, license ID: 118009, SSN: 111564949

--Let's look for the second witness: 

SELECT * 
FROM person
WHERE name LIKE "%Annab%" AND address_street_name LIKE "%Franklin%"

--Second witness is: Annabel Miller (id: 16371, 103 Franklin Ave, license ID: 490173, SSN: 318771143)
