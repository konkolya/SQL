--First, I was to find out what happened on 15/01/2018 in SQL City:

SELECT * FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE date LIKE 20180115 AND city="SQL City";

--Result: Murder. Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. 
--The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".

-- Next, I was looking for the first witness in the person table (looking for the house with the highest number in the street):

SELECT * 
FROM person
WHERE address_street_name LIKE "Northwe%"
ORDER BY address_number desc

--First witness is: Morty Schapiro (id:	14887,  4919 Northwestern Dr, license ID: 118009, SSN: 111564949)

--Let's look for the second witness: 

SELECT * 
FROM person
WHERE name LIKE "%Annab%" AND address_street_name LIKE "%Franklin%"

--Second witness is: Annabel Miller (id: 16371, 103 Franklin Ave, license ID: 490173, SSN: 318771143)

--Let's check their interview:

SELECT * 
FROM interview
WHERE person_id IN (14887, 16371);

--SCHAPIRO: I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". 
--Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
--MILLER: I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.

--Let's check gold members of the gym that have a membership number started with "48Z".

SELECT *
FROM get_fit_now_member
WHERE membership_status="gold"
AND id LIKE "%48Z%";

--Two possible persons:
--Joe GERMUSKA (id: 48Z7A, person id: 28819, membership start date: 20160305) OR
--Jeremy BOWERS (id: 48Z55, person id: 67318, membership start date: 20160101)

--Let's check who was in the gym on 9 January:
